# pk2
A rust crate for reading and writing Silkroad Online's pk2 format

It's not the best code due to a lot of rewriting and such thanks to borrowck but this project made me learn a lot about what i am allowed to do and what not. It also taught me quite well how to evade certain problems. Reading is complete, writing only works partially yet and I cant promise that I'll finish this completely.
